C

C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. It supports structured programming, 
lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
Many languages (undoubtely including C#) are very syntactically similar to C. C# is a descendant 
language of C.



Java

Java is a functional computer(since Java8) programming language that is concurrent, class-based, 
object-oriented.It is close to the C# language but bears some differences in the following: 
unsignified integers,High precision decimal numbers, complex numbers, value types and a few more.


PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but is also used as a 
general-purpose programming language. It is similar to all high level languages that use the
C style syntax such as C,C++, C#, Java and Perl.


Javascript

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, 
whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user. It uses the C language and
has some similarities with Java, but it is a prototype-based language.


Python

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.It's grammatical syntax is
not predominantly based on C-languages(including C#). Python does borrow heavily, however, 
from the expression and statement syntax of C.
