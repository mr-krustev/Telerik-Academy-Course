Syria is a traditional society with a long cultural history.
Importance is placed on family, religion, education and self-discipline and respect. 
The Syrian's taste for the traditional arts is expressed in dances such as the al-Samah, the Dabkeh in all their variations and the sword dance. 
Marriage ceremonies are occasions for the lively demonstration of folk customs.
The scribes of the city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra) created a cuneiform alphabet in the 14th century BC. 
The alphabet was written in the familiar order we use today.
