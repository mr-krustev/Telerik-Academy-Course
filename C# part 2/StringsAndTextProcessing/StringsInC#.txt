-----------------------------------------------------------

String is an immutable variable with a default value of null. It accepts all types of input(integers,doubles,DateTime) as characters.
Those inputs then can be Parsed/TryParsed to their "belonging" type. It is best used as a array of characters and is a variable
providing options for tasks with words. Some of the most important methods of String are "string.join(), string.Contains(), 
string.Equals(), string.Substring(), string.(Last)IndexOf()." and ofcourse a lot more. They provide you the opportunity to search
through the text and get information. A good way to use the information and to change the given input is StringBuilder.
